                <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing and using the Local Business AI Visibility Index website ("the Website"), you accept and
                    agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this
                    Website.</p>

                <h2>Nature of the Index</h2>
                <p>The Local Business AI Visibility Index is an independent research publication. It provides
                    classifications based on publicly observable digital signals at the time of assessment.</p>
                <p>The Index:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does not constitute a quality assessment or endorsement</li>
                    <li>Does not guarantee business performance or service delivery</li>
                    <li>Does not provide certification of any kind</li>
                    <li>Reflects point-in-time observations, not ongoing monitoring</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>No Commercial Relationship</h2>
                <p>Inclusion in this Index does not create any commercial, contractual, or advisory relationship between
                    the Index and any listed business. Businesses cannot pay to be listed, removed, or reclassified.</p>

                <h2>Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
                <p>While we endeavour to ensure accuracy, classifications are based on automated and manual analysis of
                    public signals. These signals may change, and assessments may not reflect current status.</p>
                <p>The Index makes no warranties regarding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completeness of information</li>
                    <li>Accuracy at any given time</li>
                    <li>Suitability for any particular purpose</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Local Business AI Visibility Index and its operators
                    shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising
                    from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use of or reliance on information published on this Website</li>
                    <li>Any classification assigned to a business</li>
                    <li>Errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the Index</li>
                    <li>Decisions made based on Index information</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Corrections and Disputes</h2>
                <p>Businesses may request a classification review if they believe an assessment is inaccurate due to
                    recent changes. Requests should be submitted via email to <a
                        href="mailto:corrections@aivisibilityindex.org">corrections@aivisibilityindex.org</a>.</p>
                <p>The Index reserves the right to accept or decline correction requests at its discretion. Correction
                    requests do not guarantee reclassification.</p>

                <h2>Modifications</h2>
                <p>These Terms of Use may be modified at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the Website
